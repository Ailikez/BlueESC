![BlueESC Rev1 Prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluerobotics/BlueESC/master/images/blueesc-rev1-1.jpg "BlueESC Rev1 Prototype")

The BlueESC is a simple, open-source electronic speed controller for three-phase brushless motors. It is designed to run the [SimonK firmware](http://github.com/sim-/tgy) on an Atmega8 microcontroller.

The hardware is licensed under GPLv3. It was inspired by and draws from other open-source ESC projects including [AfroESC](https://code.google.com/p/afrodevices/), [WiiESC](https://code.google.com/p/wii-esc/), and others. We owe a big thanks to everyone who has shared their open-source ESC designs and firmware.

We also thank Bernhard Konze and SimonK for the [tgy firmware](http://github.com/sim-/tgy). Please see the firmware license at the top of [tgy.asm](https://github.com/bluerobotics/tgy/blob/master/tgy.asm). The firmware configuration files for the BlueESC are maintained in [our fork of the tgy project](http://github.com/bluerobotics/tgy).

##Features

* Atmega8/168 microcontroller
* PWM, I2C, and serial signal interfaces
* 5-22 volt input (2-5s lipo)
* Reprogrammable via PWM pin using bootloader
* Status and warning LED indicators
* Sensors for voltage, current, and temperature
* No battery-eliminator-circuit (BEC)
* N-Channel MOSFETs

##Rev.1-2

The first revision was designed as a proof-of-concept. It is designed on a simple 2-layer PCB and space is not highly optimized. It exposes all interfaces and programming pins.

###Specifications

* 5-16 volt input (2-4s lipo)
* 25 amps continuous current (*not yet tested*)
* Dimensions: 41mm x 57mm (1.60" x 2.25")
* MOSFETs: Vishay SiR158DP (N-channel)

##Rev.3

The second revision is designed to work with the [BlueRobotics T100 Thruster](http://www.bluerobotics.com/thruster/). It is highly compact and is potted in an aluminum enclosure that acts as a heat sink. The board is built with two 2-layer boards, one for the power electronics and one for logic. The boards are connected by headers. This allows components to be placed on three sides, simplifies design, and minimizes cost.

###Specifications (*subject to change*)

* 5-22 volt input
* 25 amps continuous current (air)
* 35 amps continuous current (water)
* 400 uF decoupling capacitance
* Enclosure diameter: 40 mm (1.58")
* Enclosure length: 18.5 mm (0.73")

##Firmware Compilation

The BlueESC uses the tgy firmware located in the BlueRobotics fork.

*Mac:* (Uses Homebrew)

```bash
brew update
brew install avra
make bluesc.hex
```

##Initial Firmware Flashing

The BlueESC can be flashed using any AVR ISP programmer.

```bash
avrdude -c [programmer] -p m8 -U flash:w:bluesc.hex:i 
```

The fuses should be set per the instructions in the [tgy](http://github.com/sim-/tgy) instructions.

```bash
avrdude -c [programmer] -p m8 -U lfuse:w:0x3f:m -U hfuse:w:0xca:m
```

##Firmware Flashing Through Bootloader

Once the ESC has had the firmware (including bootloader) flashed the first time, it can be reprogrammed subsequently through the PWM input pin using a programmer like the [Turnigy USB Linker](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__10628__turnigy_usb_linker_for_aquastar_super_brain.html) or the [AfroESC Programmer](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__39437__afro_esc_usb_programming_tool.html). This can be done through the Makefile in the **tgy** project as follows.

```bash
make program_tgy_bluesc
```

It can also be done with avrdude and the compiled hex files as follows.

```bash
avrdude -c stk500v2 -b 9600 -P [programmer port] -p m8 -U flash:w:bluesc.hex:i
```

##I2C Commands and Address

To be completed.
